# Artifacts

## Static Website v2.0

I chose to revisit my personal draft portfolio site for one of my artifacts. I originally intended to complete my course reflection and links to projects on that site but was unable to devote as much time as I wanted on it, so I settled for making an outline of how I want to build my portfolio site in the future. My [original design](https://dekoums.github.io/portfolio-site-draft/) had issues with padding and spacing that I wanted to address the second time around, in addition to playing more with the layout. In the updated version, I added a skills bar to the [“About Me”](https://dekoums.github.io/Static-Site-v2/about.html) page which proved to be a challenge in itself, but I’m pleased with the result.

## Structured Authoring with DITA

I had fun with [this project](https://dekoums.github.io/Diffuser/) and I think the choice of content had a lot to do with it.
