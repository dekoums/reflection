# Sign Me Up!

We began the course with an analysis and reflection on our individual digital literacy and in my own journey, [my early years](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/sandras-digital-narrative/home) of tinkering with Legos instilled a degree of patience for learning digitaltechnologies that served me well throughout this course. As depicted in my Personal Learning Network (PLN), I didn’t start out with a whole lot of hands on experience with or exposure to digital writing technologies, let alone the various tools and technologies we would encounter. I reviewed the course syllabus and completed the pre-class survey with trepidation as I noted the below areas of focus and became slightly panicked about what I had just signed myself up for:

* Text editors
* HTML & CSS
* Markdown
* DITA XML
* Git & Github

I signed up to learn and did I ever! I was challenged in this course and also pushed beyond my usual comfort zone and in the end, walked away with a far greater understanding of what writing with digital technologies entails.

# Familiarity, Not Mastery

Despite my anxiety about what was to come in the course, a concept that stood out to me very early on was one that Professor Card proposed in the HTML & CSS unit: being familiar with rather than mastering a topic. From that moment on, my frame of mind for the semester was based on this idea, which isn’t to say that there was a cursory exploration of topics covered on my end—I spent _hours_ going through the course resources and additional ones I came across to supplement my learning—but rather, it was a more forgiving and realistic approach to learning and expanding my digital literacy. I mentioned patience earlier and view that ability in conjunction with this forgiving mindset as being saving graces in this course with each new topic we covered.
 
Each topic presented its own unique challenges, but the experiential learning that accompanied the discussion of these areas allowed me to dive in, level up my skills, and walk away with an arsenal of digital tools to add to my PLN. My experience in WRIT 5662 has been empowering given my starting point with digital technologies. I couldn’t tell you the first thing about HTML & CSS at the start of the course but can now leverage resources and codes to build a site from scratch and host it using Github to boot! I can now tell you that Visual Studio Code is a great beginner friendly text editor, and also the benefits of DITA XML for authoring instructions for a product. While I haven’t mastered the ins and outs of every topic area we touch on in this course, I’ve established a strong foundation to continue to build and learn from.
